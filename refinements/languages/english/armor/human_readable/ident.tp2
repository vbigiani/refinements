Delryn Family Shield +4
This is Anomen's family shield, given to him by his father. In addition to the magical protection the shield radiates an aura that grants the wielder fire and cold resistance. To protect against ranged attacks, Anomen can use the shield to erect a field of energy. This protection from normal missiles can be used three times per day.
Recently <CHARNAME> had the shield strengthened with protective magics of the Saving Grace shield, recovered from the fading avatar of Amaunator, dramatically improving its raw defensive abilities.

C2HIDE01

Aeger's Hide +5
This heavy and thick bear hide is all that remains of the fabled Aeger. Several hundred years ago the Aeger, a giant bear, terrorized hundreds of small villages up and down the Sword Coast. The bear was invulnerable to fire, cold or acid. Finally the young men and women of several villages banded together, forming a militia almost two hundred people strong. The Aeger was surrounded and finally slain. Less than a dozen villagers survived, and they carved the Aeger's hide amongst themselves. Out of one of the pieces this armor was created.
More recently, <CHARNAME> arranged for Aeger's Hide to be improved with additional enchantments. It now provides a greater resistance to physical blows and elemental attacks.

Improved Firecam Full-Plate Armor
This suit of armor was originally designed for Keldorn and few others may wear it. The suit was later enchanted again at <CHARNAME>'s request and it now provides Keldorn with even more protection. While equipped the suit provides the wearer with a +2 bonus to all saving throws and grants the wearer with free action (able to pass through webs and other effects) and immunity to fear. Despite being incredibly strong, the armor is almost weightless.

Improved Human Flesh
Made from human skin and treated with the blood of a noble dragon and combined with the soul of an innocent girl and powerful protective magic, this armor emits the stench of bitter death. The malevolent armor can only be used by a truly evil person. This is the pinnacle of dastardly protection.

Improved Ankheg Plate Mail
This plate mail has been expertly crafted. Sheathed in the chitinous scales of the ankheg, it provides a greater degree of protection than traditional plate mail and is not susceptible to rust. As any world-weary adventurer will tell you, however, the best appreciated aspect of ankheg mail is its light weight and low encumbrance. Monsters come and go but fatigue is a constant enemy. 
This particular suit of Ankheg Plate Mail was reforged for <CHARNAME>. It now provides additional protection against melee and acid attacks and allows the wearer to mimic the acid-spitting attack of the Ankheg.

Shield of Harmony +3
Audn of the Field, Knight-Champion for the wizard Kekkim, carried this shield for most of his life. It protects the bearer from most forms of mind control, a benefit for a wizard who needed warrior allies to stay faithfully at his side. Both Kekkim and Audn have long since returned to the earth, leaving the shield to whomever might recover it from Kekkim's tower.
More recently the shield was re-enchanted by <CHARNAME>. It now provides extra physical defenses and makes the bearer immune to psionics (but not the intelligence drain of the Illithid).

Corthala Family Armor
This armor, long in the Corthala bloodline, protects the user against all forms of attacks. The armor has been combined with the Shadow Dragon Armor and is now even better at protecting Valygar. The armor is enchanted so that it grants a +5 bonus to Valygar's armor class. It also adds a bonus to resisting acid, fire and magical damage. The armor also makes Valygar immune to charm while he wears it. Finally, the armor grants Valygar non-detection while equipped. As it is specially fitted for Valygar, few other than he may wear it.

A century ago, astronomers noted an unexpected comet coming to earth offshore of the Sword Coast.  An odd occurrence, it was made stranger by the lightweight fragments of metal found days later by blacksmith Huffum Fuiruim, who cared little about celestial events.  He fashioned the bulk of it into this shield, though the forging took months and the aid of several enchanters.  "From the heavens?  Nay, from my hammer!"

Chain mail +2:  'Mail of the Dead'
A mage can make an extremely effective assassin, as Vorusta illustrated over 400 years ago.  He would create skeleton warriors equipped with this enchanted armor and a powerful blade, and give their circlet of power to the target as a friendly gift.  When the killing machine was through with its work, Vorusta retrieved the equipment and started the entire process over.

Splint Mail is a variant of banded mail in which the metal strips are applied vertically to the backing of chain, leather, or cloth rather than horizontally as in banded mail.  Since the human body does not swivel in mid-torso as much as it flexes back to front, splint mail is more restrictive in battle.  This suit of armor is enchanted, granting the wearer a bonus of +1 to their armor class.

The bard appreciated the gift but painted it with wild colors to better fit into his show.

This mail feels more akin to cloth than to metal, and may be worn by thieves with few penalties and by fighter-mages without removing their spellcasting ability. This variety of mail is woven by masters in almost exactly the same form by both elves and the Drow; it has changed little since the Drow's elven past and is used for surface forays where Adamantine Drow chain would decay.
The light-coloured Elven variety of this armor has no restrictions other than class-inherent, but the dark Drow variety is magically attuned to its owner, and thus may only be worn by those of evil alignments.

This variety of mail is woven by masters in almost exactly the same form by both elves and the Drow; it has changed little since the Drow's elven past and is used for surface forays where Adamantine Drow chain would decay.
The light-coloured Elven variety of this armor has no restrictions other than class-inherent, but the dark Drow variety is magically attuned to its owner, and thus may only be worn by those of evil alignments.

This is a perfect set of armour made from the purest mithril. Mithril is mined by the dwarves, and is fashioned into very exotic and enchanted armours. Dwarven made items are expensive and hard to come by, but they are highly powerful.

The Armour of the Shield was crafted in the name of the "Order of the Shield". These were a group of paladins following in the name of Tyr.
This armour was kept by the Order for many, many years and was the symbol of hope for the entire order. 
The leader of the order was allowed to wear this armour on special occasions, and in times of great need. In battle this armour inspires all of the people nearby to be filled with new hope and courage.

Brukkar was a mighty barbarian warrior that lived in the mountains along the border between Amn and Tethyr. Brukkar wandered the wilds alone, and was very much a top predator. He was a skilled huntsman, and was wise in the ways of the mountains and of the forest. 
Brukkar found this armour when he flushed out a cave of many, many giants, all of which he killed single-handed with a few mighty swings of the huge sword he carried. 
This chain went everywhere with him, and helped the barbarian to many more feats of victory and heroism, unfortunately it also spelled the poor man's doom. He was found by a small group of adventurers, who took pity on the barbarian. Brukkar did not trust them very much, and tried to escape. The group didn't much like the barbarians hasty actions so attacked him. 
Spell after spell hit Brukkar, but he shook most of them off just with sheer will, his armour protecting him from a large majority of them. But he eventually fell, through sheer weight of numbers.

This armour is also known as the "Hell Plate", as it seems to burn on the surface with a righteous fury. 
Falgar was a man of many different names, but he was known as Falgar more commonly. The strange man claimed to come from another world, and was said to have hailed from Mount Celestia. It seemed that Falgar had come to save Faerun from peril, and that he did in the form of an Aasimar.
This armour glows in strange colours, and this glowing seems to protect the wearer from a great many different types of attacks. However nice this plate may be, it is very cumbersome to use, and is heavier than conventional suits of armour of the same style.

Garraxen, was the lord to a small kingdom, a little north of Waterdeep. The kingdom was only small, and most was farmland. He did not rule over much. His treasury was also small, but one item in particular, was one that he treasured most dear to his heart. It was a shield made from wood, but this was no simple wood. The shield almost seemed alive, and the ground beneath it shuddered below the wielder whenever it was placed on the arm. Garraxen seldom used the shield, only ever to occasionally practice his swordplay, but his love of the shield brought about his downfall.
Garraxen's land was not much known for its crime, though this time was an exception. A thief from lands afar, namely Calimshan, had heard of the shield. He came to Garraxen's lands in order to steal it; he knew he could sell it on for a tidy profit. The thief snuck into the lord's castle, without any problem and into the treasury, and past the guards. Though, the thief did not find the shield. 
Garraxen had the shield tightly guarded, near his own bed chamber, and Garraxen was not completely foolish, though when he heard a creak from that very room, Garraxen knew something was amiss. He leaped up with his sword, and charged into the room, to be promptly be dispatched by his own guards, and they found the shield to be gone in one fell swoop. The thief, thereafter, named the shield "Garraxen's Bane".

This shield was constructed, much like any other, in a forge. The forge was not different to any other, and the smith was possibly much like any normal smith of those parts.
But an accident occurred while forging this, a potion of some sorts, named a Potion of Many Mirrored Eyes, was poured all over the face of the shield. It gave it strange reactive properties.
This shield in battle, reflects light like no-other shield in existence. If used correctly, the shield can reflect light in such a way that it will blind anyone the light is reflected at. It also can protect from the gazes of umberhulks and their kin, as well as petrification and others.

This is a very small buckler, and seems to fit easily on the wrist and fits neatly. Although it is unusual for thieves to use a shield, this one seems light enough, and more useful than an average buckler. Tucked inside the top layer of the shield are several small style lock picking tools, among others to help a thief easily get through doors and other such things, and seems even to have a small set of loading weights tucked inside for use on detecting traps. This shield could be useful to even the most big time thief, and it also provides the thief with some minor protection as well.

Hell hath no fury compared to the might of the warrior known as Vriel. Vriel was a mighty warrior priest of the god, Tempus. She longed for glorious battle, and a glorious death, but it was as if Tempus did not want that to be. Every battle she was in, she seemed almost unstoppable through the power and will of her god, Tempus.
After a battle one day, against a large tide of orcs, she found a shield on one of her fallen comrades. Tempus willed her to keep the shield, and Tempus filled it with a large amount of godly power and strength, filling the wielder with a boost of energy. Not only does this shield provide protection, but it grants strength also.

Drow Chain +3
The delicate yet sturdy craftsmanship of the Elven races allows them to design many beautiful yet utilitarian goods.  Among these is Elven chain mail, which is so finely wrought that it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing its presence.  This and its lightness allows it to be worn by thieves and fighter/mages with few restrictions.
This item, like most drow equipment, is created using Adamantine, an alloy of adamantite that quickly turns to dust if removed from the Underdark.
This magical drow chain mail gives the wearer a bonus of 5% to magic resistance and takes 1 off of the speed factor of all spells cast by the wearer of the armor.

Drow Shield +3
A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield.  Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using his shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield.  Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from 3'-4' in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a spread dragon's wings.  A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward. 
This item, like most drow equipment, is created using Adamantine, an alloy of adamantite that quickly turns to dust if removed from the Underdark.

Studded leather armor has little in common with normal leather armor.  Instead of a hardened shell, studded leather offers hundreds of metal rivets affixed to a supple backing.

A clever thief, Damien Oneknife always tried to gain from the assets of his enemies, no matter the circumstances.  After an intense battle with several ghouls in which two of his companions perished, Damien decided to even the odds in future encounters.  He skinned one of the undead creatures and brought the hide to a halfling armorer talented in enchanting leather.  When the suit was finished it was magically protective against physical attacks and paralyzation.  Not very epic perhaps, but practical.

This ghastly armor was taken from an orc camp destroyed by barbarians.  Instead of standard metal rivets, like normal studded leather, this orc leather is instead laced with hundreds of fire hardened bones.  Finger bones, ribs, and skulls cover the armor, acting much like the traditional metal rivets.  Powerful orcish enchantments give the armor special resistance to missile attacks, but the repulsiveness of the armor reduces the wearer's charisma.

Enchanted ebony rivets adorn the black leather of this armor.  Umberlee the Sea Queen granted this armor to Dami Darn, a rogue who slew the conjurer Looxil.  The assassination pleased Umberlee, for Looxil had betrayed her in years past. Dami Darn died years later, a knife to the back from her successor in the thieves' guild.

This armor's namesake is a serpent only in manner, referring to the Drow assassin Raroh.  Poison was his trademark, and when he discovered this suit's susceptibility to venom, he gifted it to Avlorm, a promising novice assassin within his own guild.  When Avlorm's power eventually threatened his own, Raroh easily dispatched him, thanks to the weakness of the armor he still wore.

This heavy and thick bear hide is all that remains of the fabled Aeger.  Several hundred years ago the Aeger, a giant bear, terrorized hundreds of small villages up and down the Sword Coast.  The bear was invulnerable to fire, cold or acid.  Finally the young men and women of several villages banded together, forming a militia almost two hundred people strong.  The Aeger was surrounded and finally slain.  Less than a dozen villagers survived, and they carved the Aeger's hide amongst themselves.  Out of one of the pieces this armor was created.

Arngor of the Oak led the armies of men and elves and it is said that he dueled with the orc commander till the sun set and the land was bathed in a bloody mist.  Finally the orc fell but Arngor had sustained wounds too vast for any to save him.  His blood soaked through the armor he wore, infusing it with his courage and nobility.  Thus the Armor of the Hart became known to men.

This plate mail has been expertly crafted. Sheathed in the chitinous scales of the ankheg, it provides a greater degree of protection than traditional plate mail and is not susceptible to rust. As any world-weary adventurer will tell you, however, the best appreciated aspect of ankheg mail is its light weight and low encumbrance. Monsters come and go but fatigue is a constant enemy.

This armor has been worn by many a fine soldier, but among the best known, and for whom it was named, was Delver Kinlake.  He was a vagabond whose strong sword-arm and keen wits made him a respected general to the Lords of Waterdeep.  A gift from Lord Baeron, the armor served Delver well for thirty years, and after his death, it passed to his eldest son.  It has since made its way into the hands of a variety of adventurers, being much-desired for its strength and the magical defense it provides.

Named by Adarius Shin, the Doomplate is deserving of its foreboding title.  He had hoped to strike fear in his enemies, but Adarius set a grim precedent when he mysteriously died soon after donning the suit, just as every adventurer who has worn it since has done.  It might be said, however, that most adventurers die in their armor and are not known for their longevity.

In his aging years, Baron T'rachie coveted the wife of the lowly foot soldier Libol.  Instead of openly pursuing her and causing a scandal, he instead created this suit of armor.  He gifted it to the soldier.  This armor's curse sickened Libol and hideously disfigured him, and his wife fled from him in disgust.  Libol, trapped in the armor but not certain of T'rachie's treachery asked to be sent to the wastes for a dangerous tour of duty against marauding ogres.  He never returned and Baron T'rachie was free to pursue Libol's widow.  This armor is cursed and requires powerful magic to remove.

Shuruppak, the infamous right hand of the now dead god Gilgeam, earned the title of "Reaper" for his savage butchery of any who opposed him... an identity the bloodthirsty madman eagerly embraced.  Before Gilgeam's destruction, the god presented Shuruppak with an enchanted suit of armor, to better enable the Reaper to slaughter his foes.
Shuruppak's plate is surprisingly light and grants the wearer an unnatural quickness and grace.  It is not known how Shuruppak lost this treasured item, but one could safely assume he is still looking for it...

A small shield is usually round and is carried on the forearm, gripped with the shield hand.  Its light weight as compared to a medium shield permits the user to carry other items in that hand, although he cannot wield or carry another weapon.

A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield.  Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using his shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield.

Large Shield +1, +3 vs. Missiles:  'Shield of the Falling Stars'
Ilmater himself enchanted this shield upon seeing a young squire's willingness to endure untold agony for the wellbeing of his mount.  During a fierce battle between a human cavalry division and a hobgoblin horde, the young man was sent for reinforcements.  He was beset by a cascade of arrows that nearly blocked out the sun, and he knew that even if he avoided the arrows himself, should his horse fall he would surely be doomed.  With his shield and body he positioned himself to take the brunt of the onslaught, and was mortally wounded for it.  His horse remained unscathed allowing for their escape, and his body was carried back to the nearest town, where he was resurrected from death.

Large Shield +2:
This dwarven-made shield was commissioned by Pellan of Tyr, a brash paladin known for unquestioning courage and an almost total lack of common sense.  Upon hearing that a red dragon was ravaging the countryside, Pellan mounted his horse and rode off to do battle.  As it happened, Pellan and his armor digested readily enough, but the shield gave the dragon severe stomach cramps.  Subsequently coughed up, it lay in a hoard for years until retrieved by Pellan's son, a warrior who knew when to sneak.
Superior craftsmanship is supplemented by a permanent lightness spell, which makes the shield very easy to wield.

An odd occurrence, it was made stranger by the lightweight fragments of metal found days later by blacksmith Huffum Fuiruim, who cared little about celestial events.  He fashioned the bulk of it into this shield, though the forging took months and the aid of several enchanters.  "From the heavens?  Nay, from my hammer!"

Thought only a decoration from some forgotten festhall, this shield languished in the backroom of a shop until a young noble purchased it as parade armor.  Its dormant enchantments were discovered when a later attempt on his life was foiled as the shield reflected each attack back at the would-be assassins.  Subsequent study has linked it to Myth Rhynn, or perhaps some other ancient excavation.

Fashioned from dwarven darksteel, this heavily enchanted shield provides more protection than most suits of armor.  Legend holds that it was meant to be presented as a gift to the dwarven hero Glimred Heavyhand, but he disappeared on his ill-fated quest into the bowels of the Marching Mountains before the work was completed.  With Glimred gone, the shield was sold to the highest bidder, though the dwarven smiths refused to divulge the mysterious buyer's identity.

This finely crafted suit of armour was made by a dwarven hermit living in the mountains north of Zhentil Keep.  Many scholars think it to be magical, but others disagree, saying that its unique abilities stem entirely from the material used--cold iron--and the dwarf's skill at the forge.  Attempts at divining the difference with magic have been resisted, due to the armour's latent resistance to arcane energy.

No matter which is true--and attempts at prying the secret from the dwarf have proven futile, as he is both a loner and has never had an apprentice--it is undeniable that this field plate is flawless.  In addition to providing greater protection than a comparable suit of armour, it can even shield the wearer from the negative effects of magic.

It has an eelskin backing with scales of some unknown deep-sea creature sewn on.  Whether through magic, or merely the materials it was made with, the armour glistens even when dry, and its flamboyant colours have not been dulled from its long stay above water.

BAND04

Banded Armour +2
At a casual glance, this armour seems only to have been made of a strangely dull metal, but a second look reveals that it is in fact crafted of stone itself.  It has leather straps and backing, which appear well worn, but the bands across the chest and shoulders are in fact made of what appears to be granite.

This bizarre construction comes with an equally strange tale of how it was discovered.  It was found recently by a group of explorers searching for lost treasures of the ancients when they stumbled upon this item quite by accident.  It was not hidden in the depths of some dungeon or found in the possession of a terrible beast, but buried in the mud of a cave floor.  It was only unearthed when the group of explorers were digging a pit for their camp fire.

They decided to continue digging and found numerous other curios, including some oddly crafted bowls, spoons, crude furniture, and tools; all of which were made of stone.  There are indications that they found something else, too, but efforts to get the group to divulge what this was proved to be quite fruitless as the treasure hunters refused to make any mention of it, merely giving each other furtive glances.  Further queries were halted when the group disappeared without a trace, their only legacy the suit of armour you see before you.  The still unknown origins of the armour have confounded more than one scholar.
